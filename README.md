# ♻️ BottleConnect — Bottle Recycling Through Volunteers

## 🧠 Project Idea

Many people want to recycle plastic bottles, but they don’t have time or a car to take them to a recycling center. **BottleConnect** helps by connecting **people who want to recycle** with **volunteers** who are ready to pick up the bottles and deliver them.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The main goal is to make a simple and useful app where:

- People can submit a form with their bottle recycling request.
- Volunteers can see the list of people and choose who they want to help.
- After a volunteer clicks “Contact”, they will see full contact info.
- The request is then removed from the public list.

---

## 👥 User Roles

### 1. Person who wants to recycle

- Fills out a form: name, phone, district, number of bottles.
- Waits until a volunteer contacts them.
- After that, their request disappears from the list.

### 2. Volunteer

- Opens a page with a list of requests.
- Sees cards with basic info (no phone).
- Clicks “Contact” to help → redirected to a page with contact info.
- The request disappears from the public list.
